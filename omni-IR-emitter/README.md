# infrared sensor documentation 
A Phototransistor is a two-lead or three-lead semiconductor that is more sensitive than a photodiode. It senses light levels and uses them to alter currents to create an electrical signal.

The bipolar semiconductor can be made from silicon or another semi-conductive material.

### How do Phototransistors work?

Once detection of light such as IR (infrared), visible light or UV (Ultraviolet) is successful, the device will alter a current flowing between an emitter and collector, depending on the light and level of intensity it receives.

### Features and Benefits

•Reflow surface-mounting support

•Small, ultra-thin

•High sensitivity

•Electromagnetic noise resistance

•High linearity

•Produce a higher current than photodiodes

Where might I use a Phototransistor?

A photo transistor can be used in many different devices and applications such as:

• Photo interrupters

• Industrial electronics

• Human detection devices

• TV

• Air conditioning

• Digital photo-frames

• PCs or Laptops

• Automatic switches (lighting equipment)

• IP cameras

• Security devices

• Home electronics
