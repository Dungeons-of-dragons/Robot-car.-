# instructions 
This repo contains all the instructions, for setting up and running an example on the raspberry pi pico. 
> the raspberry pi C sdk mentions that using the kit on a UNIX system is much easier than on Windows. 

## Introduction 
Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. Key features include:
- RP2040 microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi in the United Kingdom
- Dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor, flexible clock running up to 133 MHz
- 264kB of SRAM, and 2MB of on-board flash memory
- USB 1.1 with device and host support
- Low-power sleep and dormant modes
- Drag-and-drop programming using mass storage over USB
- 26 × multi-function GPIO pins
- 2 × SPI, 2 × I2C, 2 × UART, 3 × 12-bit ADC, 16 × controllable PWM channels
- Accurate clock and timer on-chip
- Temperature sensor
- Accelerated floating-point libraries on-chip
- 8 × Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines for custom peripheral support
